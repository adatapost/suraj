HTML
==================================================================

HTML is a standard to present content/data on the web. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), an open standard orgranization define standards for web including SGML, HTML, XML, CSS and so on.

SGML (Standard Generalize Markup Language) is the base markup language. Its use is general purpose (You can design webpage, design data-structure, design math formulas, design graphics and many more) so W3C has define two standards which are derived from SGML and these two standards are called HTML and XML.

  HTML - is to present data on web.
  XML  - is to describe data for any one. XML (Extensible Markup          Language) is also known as data-format & data-exchange          protocol.

Web-browser and HTML?
 
  Web-browser implements HTMLs and other standards including XML,   JavaScript, CSS. Different web-browser vendors have different   implementations of these "Standards" so we must have to understand
  these differences theoritically & practically.

  What other tools & services a browsers have?
  -------------------------
  Web-browser is the complex software in your system and it is   constituted using number of tools & standards:
  
     Web-browser has:
          1. HTML parsers (Different parsers for different standards).
          2. XML Parsers 
             Parser is a program that is responbile to verify each and              every HTML element in a web-page and convert HTML tag into              HTML Object.
          3. JavaScript Engine
          4. CSS Modules
          5. Graphics Engine -- It draw text, graphics, images, videos
              etc.
          6. Plug-in and add-ons execution environment.
  

Why we have to use <!doctype html>?
========================================
At the top of web-doc, we must have to <!doctype html> because that way we can tell the web-browser to use "latest" and "stable" parser to create HTML objects.

If <!doctype html> is missing then web-browser will surprize you and web-browser will be running in "Quirk Mode".

if <!doctype html> is present then the running mode of browser is called "Standard Mode" and it manages lots of things on behalf of the page author.

 For example,

 <!doctype html>

 <title>This is well-formed and valid document</title>

 <h1>This is valid doc</h1>

Web-browser wont complaint about head, html and body tags.


For better understanding on HTML objects, layouts, default properties and behavior always use "Developer Tool". The Developer Tool is a software available with your (any) web-browser.


<head> -- What is the purpose of this tag?
==========================================

  <head> tag and its children are used to instruct the web-browser and
  search engine (crawler software .e.g google search, yahoo search   etc).
  
  Inside the <head>:

    1. <meta charset="utf-8"/> -- This tag instruct the web-browser         that this document has ability to represent English and non-            English text.
       
        <head>
            <meta charset="utf-8"/>
            <title>This is mixed title - &#2310;&#2360;</title>
        </head>

    2. <meta name="" content=""/> -- Used to describe the web-document.
        It describes the name of author, country it belongs, purpose
         of page and search keywords for search engine.

    3.  <meta/> is also used to set "favicon" -- icon appear when you          bookmark a page and also at addressbar.

    4.  <meta/> instructs web-browser about MIME content-type, cache-         controls.

    5.  For prograssive CSS, you can add <link/> tag inside the head             tag. 

    6.  Some people(developer) also uses <head> area for JavaScript         <script> block. But we should have to avoid <script> code under
        the <head>.

        Add script code at bottom of document so web-browser can render         HTML & CSS content without blocked by JavaScript code.
