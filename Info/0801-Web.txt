Context or Virtual Directory or Alias
==================================================================

It is file system folder that is linked or glued to apache-webserver and PHP development environment and it contains "resources" which are serve via HTTP protocol.

Bydefault x:\wamp\www folder is the location in which we can create virtual directories or aliases. However if you wish to create an alias outside the x:\wamp\www then add configuration section into httpd.conf file.
   for example:

          Alias /hello  "c:/pqr"

 So http://localhost  is called "servername" or "domain name"

    http://localhost/  <--- is "/" is called root or main alias.

    http://localhost/test/ <----- "/test is sub-alias


 127.0.0.1 - loopback IP of current machine (self IP).
 Or
 localhost
