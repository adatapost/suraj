The Web Platform (Framework)
=========================================================

 What is a "Framework"?

   It is specifically a programming environment. This env acts as "IoC"    behavior (Hollywood principle - Dont call us, we will call you) so
   developer can design his/her application as per platform's norms.

 Under the web-platform, we will have to understand and use other sub- frameworks including - client-framework, server-framework and so on.


 Client frameworks:

     1. Web-browser (Html, CSS, JavaScript)
     2. Dekstop Or Windows API (Application Programmin Interface)


 Server Frameworks:

     1. PHP, .NET, Java, Ruby, Python etc
     2. HTTP Servers
     3. Database servers and so on.
  


Web Resources
====================================================

  It is the most important unit of web-application. The web-resource   can be a "static" or "dynamic".

  Static Resource : A resource whose content cannot be changed   automatically unless his/her author change it. These resources are  .html, .js, .css, images, video, audio etc files.


  Dynamic Resource : A resource that produce or generate dynamic content of HTML/CSS/JavaScript and data is known as "dynamic" resource.
  These resources are always "programs" written in Java,C#, PHP, Ruby,   Python, C/C++ etc languages.

 In short, our webapplication (Or our project) is made up of number of  static and dynamic resources.


What softwares are needed to develop and deploy the webapplication?
================================================================

 In order to develop & deploy PHP web app we must have to install following softwares:

   1. HTTP Or Web Server 
   2. Application Server (PHP)
   3. And optionally -- database server


Web/HTTP Server
----------------

    It receives request from web-browser (client) for a resource. It returns error-page is the requested resource is not resolve.

    It returns copy of requested resource to the web-browser if that     requested resource is "Static Resource".

    It forwards requested resource to application servr (PHP) if that     requested resource is "dynamic resource".


    By default web-server listen to the PORT 80 and ofcourse we can     have different ports too.

    
   The application server process the "dynamic resource", produce output and send produced output to the web-server so web-server forward this output to the web-browser.

  Client    Request for resource
  (Browser) =========================>  WebServer (Apache)
                                          
           <===========================    ||     /\
               Response                    ||     ||     
                                           \/     ||
                                        Application Server (PHP)
                                              ||
                                              ||
                                             Databases


Where to find "HTTP Server, PHP, MySql"?
-----------------------------------------------

   In fact, Apache, PHP and MySql are open source projects and we need    their build versions or we need to build source code on our own.

   Two bundles exists that consists pre-compiled (build) and pre-   configured Apache, MySql and PHP.

   These bundle are for Linux (LAMP) and
                    for Windows (WAMP) operating systems.
   [Note: XAMPP bundle is configured for any OS]

   X - For any OS           W - Window OS      L - Linux
   A - for Apache           A  - Apache        A - Apache
   M - MySql                M - MySql          M - Mysql
   P - PHP                  P - PHP            P - PHP
   P - Perl

   We just need to download 32 or 64 bits build.
